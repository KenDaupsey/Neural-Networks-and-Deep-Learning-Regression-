# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-Regression-

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network-based regression model using deep learning techniques for predicting continuous outcomes such as academic performance scores. Neural networks are powerful machine learning models inspired by the human brain's biological neural networks and are capable of capturing complex non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

Project Description
The project involves loading a dataset containing information about students' academic performance, including reading and writing scores. It selects the desired features (reading and writing scores) and the target variable (math score), splits the data into training and testing sets, and then builds and trains a neural network regression model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions. The data is standardized before training, and the model is trained using the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer. The trained model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and its training and validation loss curves are plotted. Additionally, the project showcases how to use the trained model for making predictions on a new data point.

Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script containing the code.
The script will load the dataset, select the desired features and target variable, split the data into training and testing sets, standardize the data, build and train the neural network regression model, evaluate its performance on the test set, plot the training and validation loss curves, and demonstrate how to use the trained model for making predictions on a new data point.
